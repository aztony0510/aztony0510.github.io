# Favorite CPSC120L Labs

Lab 1 part 1

This was one of my favorite lab as it was just something to help us start 
getting to know the process of how everything works and how the language 
works it shows us how to start cloning things and throwing them into folders
in the computer and how to actually start coding them and also how to push 
the repository and make sure the repository does submit into the github.

Lab 5 part 1
This was my second favorite lab as it made us calculate the area
of a rectangle and it also showed us the steps on how to code it and show 
the process of the area and what the calculations are exactly. 
We also got to get used to new code such as using cin and cout to use them 
as the input and the output.

Lab 6 part 1 
This was my favorite lab as we made a whole code to have it take 
our ingredients and make them into a sandwich also being able to select 
what bread protein and condiments we want on the sandwich. 
This was cool to experience to show how the code works exactly and how the code turns out.
